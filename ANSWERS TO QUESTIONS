1. Why does the parser say "Identifier expected, found = "?
This occurs because the BNF expects an idenitier on the left side of the "=" symbol, but because there is a ++ which is invalid. 
2. Why does the error message say "Equal sign expect, found D" when using float delcaration?
This occurs because in the declaration thr parser its exepcting an integer delcaration.
